# CS201 APTs

APTs (algorithmic problem-solving and testing) are short programming problems similar to those found on Leetcode and Hackerrank. The purpose of APTs is to solidify concepts learned in class - as a result, many of my solutions aim to solve the problem, and are not necessarily the most optimal programs in terms of efficiency.

## On Duke's Community Standard:
In accordance with Duke's community standard, students are not permitted to replicate code found on the internet. As such, students should not refer to this repo for help, that is a violation of Duke's policy - my answers are posted here as part of my portfolio, not to be reused by future CS201 students.
